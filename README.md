# Your Advent Calendar
Hello Mary! I made you this calendar using the little knowledge I have of some programming languages. I don't know much about coding, as it turns out, so it's definitely not as robust as I'd like it to be. Next year maybe :)
Here is the deal: this calendar merely displays pictures, which AREN'T linked to any media. So, you will use the position of each day leading up to Christmas to determine the media you should open that day. For example, day one is in position B4, so on the cheat sheet I have provided you will go to the link for position B4.
Because I wanted to make this extra spicy, I added another layer of chaos: each link on the cheat sheet is a cipher. I know that this is getting a little crazy, but it's just a simple Cesear cipher, and the shift corresponds to the day of December it is. So on December 6th, the shift is 6 letters. Anything that is NOT plain text is not ciphered.
Everything you should need for this advent calendar are within this repository. I've tried to write out the steps so it's a little more clear:
1. Download the whole AdventCalendar file to your computer
2. Move this folder from downloads to desktop
3. Open index.html with Safari (or Chrome, I think... idk I haven't tried it)
4. In the window, click "Create Calendar"
5. Click on the number corresponding to the day of the month it is
6. Open the word file and find the corresponding link 
7. Decrypt it using the linked crytographer
8. Enjoy :)
